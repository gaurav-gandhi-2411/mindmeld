# PLAN — Phase 6c: Themed Packs (living tracker)

Spec: `spec-phase6c.md` (source of truth). Scope: pack SYSTEM + Bollywood flagship only; Cricket / Indian Food / Nature & Wild as content-drop stubs.

## Cross-side contract (generator ↔ app) — FROZEN

- **Payload namespace:** `{baseUrl}/packs/{packId}/{lang}/{NNN}.json.gz`, `NNN` = 1-based zero-padded 3 (`001`…`025`).
- **Pack payload JSON:** identical v3 daily schema PLUS `"pack": "<packId>"`, `"idx": <int>`; `"date"` carries the opaque key `"<packId>-<NNN>"` (Dart never DateTime.parses payload date — verified `models.dart`).
- **Salt:** pack payloads derive salt from the opaque key + lang via the same sha1 recipe (new helper; daily path stays byte-identical).
- **Pack manifest** (published `{baseUrl}/packs/manifest.json`, bundled fallback `app/assets/payloads/packs/manifest.json`):
  ```json
  { "v": 1, "packs": [ { "id": "bollywood",
      "title": {"en": "Bollywood", "hi-en": "Bollywood"},
      "tagline": {"en": "…", "hi-en": "…"},
      "free": true, "status": "live",
      "accent": "#E8B23A", "accentDark": "#8E1A2B",
      "icon": "film", "langs": ["en", "hi-en"], "count": 25 } ] }
  ```
  `status`: `live` | `coming_soon`; stubs have `count: 0`.
- **Pack lineup + identity:** bollywood (film icon, gold `#E8B23A` / crimson `#8E1A2B`, free, live) · cricket (green `#2E7D32`) · indian-food (turmeric `#E65100`) · nature-wild (teal `#00695C`) — the last three `coming_soon`, count 0.
- **Persistence:** new sqlite table (schema v4) `pack_progress(pack_id, idx, lang, guesses_json, hints_used, won, gave_up, revealed_hints_json, PK(pack_id, idx, lang))`. Pack play NEVER writes `stats` or `day_state`.
- **IAP:** `Entitlements.packs: Set<String>`; gateway `purchasePack(packId)` → RC product `mm_pack_{id}` / entitlement `pack_{id}`. Unlock rule: `pack.free || web (iapEnabledEffective==false) || entitlements.packs.contains(id)`.
- **Share card:** pack games render `Mindmeld · {PackTitle} #{idx} {langLabel} {emoji trail}`; daily format unchanged.

## Status

- [x] 6b pushed; HEAD=origin/main=85979bc → spec committed 8b4e064
- [x] Executor A done: packs.py, build_packs.py (`uv run build-packs --packs all --langs en,hi-en --out ../payloads --strict-sizes`), publish syncs packs/ tree, 4-pack scaffolding, pytest 336 passed + 8 pack-gate skips (activate with content), ruff clean on touched files. NOTE: publish.py does NOT invoke build-packs — pack publish = run build-packs into the dir publish syncs from (orchestrate at drop time).
- [x] Bollywood content files written (packs/bollywood/*), hinglish.txt +11 words, hi-en-aliases.txt +14 entries, eval fixtures P01–P11. Generator suite GREEN: 349 passed, 6 skipped (empty stubs). Spoiler gate caught 5 subtle leaks during authoring (agar~pyar, paas~maa, her⊂mother, the⊂mother, one~song) — all reworded; audit script confirms 0 leaks across all 50 clues.
- [x] Executor B done: Flutter pack system (catalog, selector, pack play, persistence v4, IAP, share, identity). flutter test 376/376, analyze clean. Committed 83d98a8 (generator) + b3e75c4 (app), pushed.
- [x] Bollywood content validated over 3 embedding rounds. FINAL 25 pairs (EN/hi-en):
  romance/pyaar, hero/hero, villain/villain, dance/naach, song/geet, mother/maa, drama/natak,
  tears/aansoo, dialogue/dialogue, destiny/kismat, promise/vaada, revenge/badla, police/police,
  honor/izzat, sacrifice/qurbani, story/kahani, twist/twist, star/sitara, anger/gussa,
  fight/ladai, gossip/gossip, audience/audience, youth/jawaani, ticket/ticket, award/award.
  REJECTED (model misreads romanization): dil→Turkish "language", dua→Italian "due", jalan→Malay
  "road", milan→city, dushman .29, dhadkan .29, pooja .28, dulhaniya .22, intezaar .16, dosti .36,
  yaari .33, barsaat .39, saawan, dhun; EN `interval` (math neighborhood). Code-mixed EN secrets
  (hero, villain, dialogue, twist, gossip, police, audience, ticket, award) verified dense in BOTH vocabs.
  11 hinglish.txt additions needed: natak, geet, aansoo, kismat, badla, vaada, qurbani, kahani,
  sitara, ladai, jawaani — eval fixtures P01–P11 pre-validated 11/11 PASS (thinnest: ladai .435>.398).
  Aliases to add: naatak, ansoo/aansu/ansu, kismet/qismat, waada (NOT wada/vada — food collision),
  kurbani, kahaani, sitaara, ladaai/larai, jawani, nach, pyar, ghussa, izat, ma.
- [x] **STOP POINT cleared 2026-07-09**: GG approved content WITH edits. Applied: 3 GG rewords (EN #5/#16/#23), item-song kept only on #4 (hi-en #23 reworded), whistle/seeti + front/first row + first show de-duplicated (#2/#9/#22/#24). Semantic-neighbor audit over all 50 clues reworded 5 more: lyrics→#5 hi-en, line→#9 both, giraftaar→#13 hi-en, Overacting→#7 EN, Picture→#16 hi-en; EN #19 moved off the seventies archetype (collision with new #23). 13/50 clues changed total.
- [x] Payloads baked + published: 25×2 payloads + packs manifest, all under size targets (--strict-sizes), byte-reproducibility gate PASS after fixing hash-seed-dependent alt-map ordering in payload.py (5b7ddd6 — hi-en payloads were non-reproducible cross-process; regression test added). Pages commit fda0bba.
- [x] Web app deployed to playmindmeld.vercel.app (registrant + auth-domain guards OK, SW mindmeld-precache-68baf9ba2a5d verified live).
- [x] Cold-profile live verify on playmindmeld.vercel.app — ALL PASS (15 cold runs, screenshots reviewed): V1 selector gold→crimson Bollywood identity + 3 coming-soon tiles; V2 EN #1 start-to-win (wedding #889 Warm → movie #375 Hot → romance win); V3 hi-en win (shaadi → pyaar) with localized tagline; V4 share text `Mindmeld · Bollywood #1 (English) 🟨🟧⭐ / 3/15 · Par -6`; V5 pack win leaves Stats at Played 0/Streak 0 and daily unplayed, then daily win works normally. Zero pageerror/requestfailed across all runs. (Pages publish was delayed ~35 min by a GitHub Actions partial outage — queue only, no action needed.)
- [x] Full suites green: generator 350 passed / 6 skipped, flutter 376/376, ruff clean.

## Known issues (found during 6c live verify, NOT 6c regressions)

- [x] **P1 — daily win screen "Back" is a dead end for the rest of the day** — FIXED. `main.dart`'s tabbed Scaffold (NavigationBar + IndexedStack) is now always the home surface; only the index-0 child swaps between `_WinShell`/`_LossShell` and the live `PuzzleScreen`. Restart/lang-switch routing moved to `_AppShellState._deriveResultRouting`. `PuzzleScreen._load()`'s already-finished-state `onWin`/`onLoss` redirect is now scoped to pack mode only (daily mode's routing is owned exclusively by the app shell, keeping `onWin`/`onLoss` idempotent across remounts — that idempotency gap was the actual root cause of the bounce-back). Commits 5eb4869 (fix) + 1870a9c (tests: `app/test/daily_win_navigation_test.dart`, 6 cases). flutter test 382/382 (376 baseline + 6 new), analyze clean.

- [x] **Follow-up — StatsScreen stale after same-session win** — FIXED (2e596b0). Exposed by the P1 fix (Stats became reachable post-win and showed boot-time Played 0/Streak 0). Persistence was proven fine live (win → reload → 1/1); root cause: `StatsScreen._load()` ran only in initState while eagerly mounted in the IndexedStack. Now reloads on tab activation (`active: _navIndex == 2`) and lang change. flutter test 384/384.
- [ ] **Follow-up sweep (low visibility): other eagerly-mounted tabs never reload in-session** — ArchiveScreen (Practice) and SocialHomeScreen load once in initState like StatsScreen did. Apply the same activation-reload pattern if/where their data can change mid-session.
- [x] **Both fixes live-verified on production 2026-07-10** (cold profile, build 05ae5e251932): daily win → nav bar present on win screen → Back lands on finished board and stays → Stats tab shows Played 1/100%/Streak 1/Best 1 same-session → Practice, Friends, Themed Packs → Bollywood list all reachable. Zero pageerror/requestfailed.

## Gotchas discovered

- `derive_salt(puzzle_date: date, lang)` takes a datetime.date — pack build needs a string-key variant, daily output must remain byte-identical.
- hi-en secrets are romanized-Hindi words line-paired with EN (`samunder`↔`ocean`); pack content follows the same format.
- Flutter SDK not on PATH: `C:\Users\gaura\sdks\flutter\bin`. Tests: `flutter test --concurrency=1`.
- Daily secrets already use: ocean/samunder, music/gaana, rain/baarish, family/parivar, dream/sapna … — avoid duplicating in pack (check full 60 before finalizing).
